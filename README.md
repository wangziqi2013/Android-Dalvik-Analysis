# Android-Dalvik-Analysis

I implemented an Android Dex (Dalvik Executable) format reader and disassembler in C++. The code is super fast, and runs stably on several testing Dex files. Currently this tools has two parts, a dex file reader and a bytecode decoder (disassembler). In the next section they will be introduced briefly.
